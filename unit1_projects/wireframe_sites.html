			<h2 class="website_name">Apple, Inc.</h2>
			<p id="paragraph1">I think its pretty clear that Apple is trying to make their products look as attractive as possible. It seems as though they want the user's focus to be on the products. Their photography and large imaging make it easy to see every little detail. They also made the navigation bar very simple, without any dropdown menus. It almost looks like you can touch it. The problem they solve is educating the consumer on the value of their products. Without the vivid, high quality images, it would be difficult for the consumer to know that Apple's products are of a higher caliber than most other hardware makers.</p>

			<h2 class="website_name">YouTube</h2>
			<p id="paragraph2">YouTube solves a very important content delivery problem. They offer the user a highly reliable video streaming service, in a player that is easy to use. The format of the user interface is very recognisable, and was pretty much poineered by YouTube. Despite being relatively boring in design, the functionality is very good, and people have become accepting of the look because of the reliability and quality of the service that YouTube offers.</p>

			<h2 class="website_name">Google, Inc.</h2>
			<p id="paragraph3">Google solves the problem of distraction during a web search. The approach that Google takes, eliminates any distractions for the person who is looking for something. This approach is taken prior to the actual search. Once the user clicks on the search button, then the interface quickly becomes somewhat more complex. Still, when being tasked with listing millions upon millions of results for a user, Google does a very good job of presenting them.</p>
