				<h1 class="page_title">My Values</h1>

				<h2 class="header">My Values</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">I remember a period of time when I was in my early 20's (not too long ago!) where I really felt very happy about where I was in my life. When I think about the this period, the following values come to mind:</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
				<ul class="in_page">
					<li>Accomplishment</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
					<li>Excellence</li>
					<li>Creativity</li>
					<li>Quality</li>
					<li>Passion</li>
					<li>Work Ethic</li>
					<li>Friendships</li>
					<li>Design</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Although every one of those values are important to me (especially Design), the one that stands out right now is Quality. I picked Quality because that term can be applied to many aspects of ones life and relationships. I find myself frequently preaching to my close friends about quality. Quality can describe people in terms of how genuine they are and also how they treat themselves and others. It can also be used to describe the caliber of ones achievements. Its also most commonly associated with products, which is also notable when you consider the software field. Quality can describe a design, or an idea/thought. But most importantly, I think Quality describes the way someone lives their life. From the time you wake in the morning until you go to bed, Quality is the barometer by which you can asses your contributions to the world. I love when people do things for the sake of greatness, even if it is not expected of them. I would rather have one great friend/product/experience instead of multiple half-rate ones. Quality is so important in everything we do.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				<ul class="in_page">
					<li>Accomplishment - 1</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm - 4</li>
					<li>Excellence - 3</li>
					<li>Creativity - 5</li>
					<li>Quality - 4</li>
					<li>Passion - 4</li>
					<li>Work Ethic - 5</li>
					<li>Friendships - 5</li>
					<li>Design - 5</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2 id="header">Advice</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">The most common - and most recent - advice that I have given is "What kind of car should I get". This is funny, but its true! Yeah I know, its not a very deep answer... Anyway, pretty much all of my friends, family, and aquaintences know that I am passionate about two things. Cars and Design. People come to me for advice on those topics, especially cars since so many of them drive and can use advice here and there. I am passionate about automobiles, and I guess I've made that pretty obvious.</p>
			<h2 id="header">Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">I use my values as motivation sometimes. I think about what is important to me and what it would feel like showing my work to someone. I think about the pride that I have in my close friends. The quality of my friends and work are what motivate me. I think that motivation helps me try to achieve greater and greater things, which I can admire from a distance. I think they also help with stereotype threat because they serve as a reminder of ones value. When I'm feeling down I like doing 4 things in particular. First, I like to do something physical like going to the gym or doing a sport. I love kick boxing and martial arts. They require such discipline and control, and I feel like I grow everytime I engage in them. Secondly, I like listening to music - sometimes at high volume. I do this to quickly change my mindset. Music is one of those mysterious things affects people, but we just dont know why. Sometimes I'll jump around and dance to get the full effect. Other times I'll just zone out. Thirdly, I sometimes listen to interviews and speeches from the few people that I really admire. For example, when I feel my motivation or passion slipping, I'll watch Steve Jobs videos. I have so much respect for the guy that watching him helps get me focused again. He helps me remember that we all have the power to put a dent into the universe, and a life spent pursuing that is a life not wasted. Finally, I love driving. When I feel down, I simply go out for a drive sometimes. It just clears my mind.</p>
