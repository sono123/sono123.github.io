			<h2 id="website_name">Static Positioning</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">HTML elements are positioned static by default. A static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>

		<div id="page_body">
			<h2 id="website_name">Relative Positioning</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position. The content of relatively positioned elements can be moved and overlap other elements, but the reserved space for the element is still preserved in the normal flow.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="image_div">
			<img id="absolute" src="../unit1_projects/images/absolute.png">
		</div>

		<div id="page_body">
			<h2 id="website_name">Absolute Positioning</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing block is html. Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the absolutely positioned element does not exist. So basically, you can position an element somewhere on the page, and it will stay in the same place within its parent div. It will still move with the page when the page is scrolled or resized.</p>

		<div class="image_div">

		<div id="page_body">
			<h2 id="website_name">Fixed Positioning</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">An element with fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window. It will not move even if the window is scrolled. Fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the fixed positioned element does not exist. In short, you can scroll the page and the div wont move. It will let the page move underneath it.</p>
