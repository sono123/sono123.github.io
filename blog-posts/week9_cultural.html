				<h2 class="header">Questions</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">I've always placed a good deal of emphasis on asking questions. In sales, its one of the most effective tools that I've ever used. In education, feeling comfortable asking questions is critical to ones success. In expanding ones intelligence, asking questions are the manifestation of curiousity. So clearly, asking questions matter, and I've known this for some time. However, despite this knowledge, it never ocurrd to me that the quality of the questions can have a big impact on the answers you get.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">With the exception of asking questions as a sales tool (asking questions is the easiest way to control a conversation), I havent put much thought into the manner in which I ask questions. Looking around, I can see how my technique can use some improvement.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">First, my questions seem to be a little bit long. I have a habit of being a little too descriptive when asking them. I guess it's because I worry that the question isn't clear enough to get a worthwhile answer, so I just keep adding detail to it. This is something that can easily be remedied by simply being more efficient. Just proofreading an email or editorial will reveal many areas that can be improved and simplified. This approach can be applied to asking questions, at least written ones.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Another thing that I've noticed about myself when asking questions is that I tend to assume that the recipient has some prior knowledge of the subject matter. This typically happens at work. When I ask someone something about a specific thing, I frequently assume that they know the background on the question. Needless to say, this is not a good assumption to make, even though the people I am referencing sit within feet of me. Most of the time they arent paying any attention to my personal conversations and would have no idea what I am doing. It would probably serve me well to preface certain questions with a background. Or possibly introduce the question vaguely and then give a background right away.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Learning about asking questions has been very revealing with respect to my own habits. I think there is much to gain simply be adjusting the two things mentioned above. I'm sure there are many more things that I can do, but for starters, those will be very helpful.</p>
