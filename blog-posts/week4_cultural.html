			<h2 id="website_name">Solving A Driving Issue</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">When you think "Tech" you dont always think about cars. Things that come to mind are electronics, usually gadgets and devices. However, when you ask yourself what the major development platforms for everyday consumers, cars are quickly becoming more and more relevent. Here is the problem, there are so many features that are becoming standard in cars that it is difficult to control them effectively while driving safely. Furthermore, there is a demand for automotive technologies to integrage with person devices such as smartphones and tablets. Its a mess out there, and a dangerous one at that.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">According to the NHTSA, texting and driving has been more distructive than drunk driving. This is an incredibly powerful statement. Although they dont mention other forms of distraction, operating your navigation, radio, climate control, and bluetooth paired phone through your cars UI is also know to cause many accidents. This is apparent by the numerous disclaimers that car manufacturers are required to flash when you start your car. This issue of distraction is further compounded by the poor solutions that car manufacturers are implementing. The user interfaces are far from intuitive, with some being downright difficult to operate. When you're driving, this matters.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">What are tech companies doing about this? Apple and Google are now offering hardware / software packages that are aiming to simplify the user interface, and seemlessly integrate with mobile devices that are brought into the car. This may sound like a good idea, which it is. However, ideas and execution are two totally different things. For example, the placement of the screens is below the sight line. This causes the user to have to operate a tablet-like screen while driving and looking away from the road. It doesnt solve the problem.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The only way to solve this problem is to move the UI to the windshield. Almost all companies offer "heads up displays" that project images onto the windshield. This allows the driver to keep their hands on the windshield at all times. This technology is making its way into compacts and even economy cars. The only issue at the moment is that the size is limited to about an 8" viewing area. To solve this problem, large areas of the windshield would need to display images. This would require a transparent screen as opposed to a projector based solution.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">This solution is probably years away from being implented. However, it is reassuring to see that its been used in aviation for decades. This technology will eventually trickle down to cars. Its viable and proven, and I would bet my house (if I had one) on the fact that it will eventually be the industry standard. Hopefully this happens sooner than later because the statistics highlight a problem that is bigger than most people realize.</p>
