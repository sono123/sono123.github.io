			<h2 id="website_name">Concrete Sequential, Really?</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Concrete sequential thinkers are categorized as people who prefer to do things in order, logically. These thinkers prefer to do things according to a set sequence, and also prefer directions when possible. They tend to like a structured environment and feel most comfortable in a predictable environment. Pragmatism is a common trait among these types of thinkers.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Concrete sequential thinkers typically do not do well working in groups. They prefer discussions that have a topic and clear resolution, but dislike open ended discussions. They dont like disorganized environments, nor do they like unclear instructions. Abstract ideas and imaginative tasks are not ideal for them. They require evidence, yes or no answers, and sequence.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">I am categorized as a concrete sequential thinker. This has been confirmed by 2 different tests. While researching this blog, I was really surprised that I ended up in this category? The reason is because I find myself to be really good at improvisation and creative solutions. I love working in groups and I find that I feed off other's energy (if they are positive of course). I love abstract and random discussions that lead to unique perspectives, even if they dont yield an answer. Finally, I always listen to my gut. I believe in intuition and subconscious, and I think tapping into those signals is one of the best things you can learn to do.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">So what do I do then? Well, I am going to base my thinking style on the descriptions that I see, rather than the test results. That is how strongly I feel about the test results incorrectly describing my personality. I think I am more of an abstract sequential thinker, or maybe a concrete random thinker. Either way, I'm dont see myself as a concrete sequential thinker so I'm not going to pretend that I am.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Now that we have that out of the way, I think the hardest part of Phase 0 has been the timing, or lack of time. I am a pretty slow reader. I pick up concepts quite quick, but I have had a hard time reading and comprehending all of the assigned material within the given timeframe. Thus I've had to skip some of it. The other challenge for me is that I dont really like studying by myself at home. I like being around others and working in groups. I really love seeing other peoples perspectives when solving a problem. I think I can address these issues by doing a couple things. First, making more time for myself. This week was tough, but next week I think I can leave early from work at least 4 days out of the week. That will most definitely help. Secondly, I can maybe do an extra pairing session each week. This will give me a little more interaction, which I would certainly welcome.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">As far as my learning style goes, I think I can inprove by committing to meditation. I strongly believe in the power of meditation, and I've been lazy over the last year and stopped doing it. I will start again this week.</p>
