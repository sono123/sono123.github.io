			<h2 id="website_name">Stereotype threat</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">This is a very interesting topic, one that I had never heard of before. While researching this topic, I saw some very conflicting opinions on the matter. This made for some very entertaining reading. It also provided supporting and countering arguments for me to base my opinion on. This post is my personal opinion on stereotype threat and its implications on our society.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">First of all, I want to come right out and say that I think stereotype threat is a very real thing. I truly believe an individuals performance can be affected by stress, anxiety, and fear, among other emotions. I think this is measurable in a clinical sense, and if you simply ask anyone what they think, it is likely they will confirm this phenomenon from personal experience. I would be surprised if there was any debate there. However, the biggest area of controversy (according to my reading) is whether the stereotypes themselves are legitimate or not.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">A "Chicken vs. Egg" debate seems to rage in the user comments sections of many articles. Many people raise the question about where the stereotypes came from in the first place. While others believe that the stereotype threat is the reason for the stereotype. Its honestly a very sensitive topic that nobody wants to really touch, at least not through an editorial. Are there inherent weakness between genders and races? Or is this fabricated?</p>
			<p class="paragraph">I personally believe that the real answer lies somewhere in the middle. I think ethnic groups and genders have unique strengths and weaknesses. I think these are more evolutionary than anything else. Particularly with gender. I think women are evolved to be better at certain things, and the same holds true with men. The most obvious example would be size. Men are generally bigger than women, which obviously served some sort of Darwinian purpose. But this does not mean that there arent exceptions. For example, some women are bigger than men. I personally think over time certain strengths and weaknesses were noticed in certain groups, and certain people exaggerated those weaknesses, causing more measurable difference as a result of stereotype threat. In other words, some very minor evidence was exaggerated, and them compounded exponentially due to the stereotype threat mechanism. I want to further clarify that there are many exceptions, as indicated in the male / female size example. Perhaps even more so than that.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">I also think that many people are positively affected by pressure, stress, and anxiety. Though I dont think this is a healthy way to live, I do know of many circumstances where I've done better work than normal due to fear or anxiety. Its tough to admit this, but its true. This is probably not the case for everyone, but its certainly the case for many. So despite the fact that I absolutely believe in stereotype threat, I think its misrepresented as a catylist for ONLY negative performance. An example would be unionized vs. non-union companies. Unionized companies are known for job security, in some cases to a fault. Non-union companies can hire/fire at will. The statistics would suggest that negative reinforcement (fear of losing your job) keeps the masses functioning at a higher degree of productivity.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">In conclusion, I think stereotype threat is real. I also think stereotypes originate from some degree of truth, granted a small fraction of what the stereotype is (based on statistics and evolutionary reasons). I believe that stereotypes are generalization that cannot possibly be true for the entire group / gender. I think stereotype threat is used as an explanation statistical performance, which is the wrong reason to discuss this intriguing phenomenon. I also think that fear, stress, and other underlying emotions behind stereotype threat can also fuel better performance in certain settings. Lastly, I think the only way to deal with stereotype threat is to develop self confidence and self worth. This is something that is easier said than done, and takes years to do, but is definitely attainable and crucially important. Did someone say meditation?</p>
