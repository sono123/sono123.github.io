				<h2 id="header">The Internet</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">The internet is something that most of us take for granted everyday. It's one of those things that is difficult to really appreciate until it is taken away. Perhaps one of the most influential and distruptive technologies ever created, the internet can be considered a tool that has accelerated the development of our society.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The internet is simply a vast global network of interconnected computers. It is no different in concept than the local network setups that we've all encountered in an office or home. This global system of networked computers rely on an agreed protocol called TCP/IP, which allows the billions of devices around the world to communicate with eachother.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The way the internet works is that each device has its own unique IP address, which essentially gives that device its own name that cannot be confused with another device. Since the number of devices that require IP addresses has grown into the billions, the naming system has been expanded to accomodate. These devices can send data to eachother via a system of hardware (physical infrastructure) and software (software systems such as the world wide web). In the middle are internet service providers who are tasked with providing the resources (additional hardware and software and energy) to send data from device to device.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Commonly referred to the world wide web, the internet is actually very different. The internet is the hardware, meaning the physical devices and their connection points. The world wide web is the software that allows people to interact with documents and applications that are formatted for use on this particular platform.</p>
