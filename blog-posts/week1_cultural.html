			<p id="paragraph">After a week 1 of Phase 0, I can say that there were many surprises that I didnt expect. The experience was definitely a positive one though. I'll start with the negative first, just so we can get that out of the way.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">My only complaints would revolve around the necessary time to commit to this program. I didnt realize that there would be this amount of work during Phase 0. I totally acknowledge that I may have simply not noticed this information when reading about the course, but I do think it wasnt spelled out clear enough. I work around 60 hours a week at my family business. Although I have flexibility, this makes it very difficult to to find the additional 15-25 hours per week.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">As for the positives, I love the Kitchen vs. Table analogy that Sherif made. I am definitely the type of person who likes to push the boundaries and change things. I like to extract the most that I can out of many situations. I love positive energy, and hard working people. It was such a relief to hear that this type of attitude is encouraged at Dev Bootcamp. I've definitly had thoughts ranging from "Will this program be good enough?" to "Am I good enough". So, it was nice to hear that other people have had a similar internal dialog. The truth is, I really didnt know what to expect going forward, but I knew that I am willing to bust my ass. After hearing Sherif speak about how this program works, I feel much more confident that I will get everything and some out of this experience.</p>
