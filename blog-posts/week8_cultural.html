				<h2 class="header">Dealing With Conflict</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">I can recall many conflicts that I've had with my family members over the years. I think these are probably the most common source of conflict in my life. One in particular comes to mind where myself and my father had a disagreement about how to make a business decision. Being business partners, these things come up quite often, and sometimes we dont see eye to eye.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">In this case, I knew my stance was the correct one. That isnt always the case, but this time is most definitely was. Due to this fact, I was considerably more confrontational than I normally would have been. This negative energy made the conflict worse, and it resulted in little progress and much wasted time. My actions did not help the situation.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Looking back on this and many other conflicts, I am quick to make my point, regardless of how it comes across to the other person (usually my dad). This is a destructive habit because it alienates people, and usually results in the exact opposite of what you are trying to achieve or debate. I've been slowly and steadily doing things differently when these things come up. I've noticed that I react much better when I give myself a few minutes to cool off before responding. This is actually extremely effective for me.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">When these things happen, I learn a little bit more each time about how pointless it is to get upset over small things. Small things shouldn't be ignored, but they should not cause the flare ups that tend to occur, particularly with family members. At the end of the day, its just not worth it and I never look back on it as a positive thing.</p>
