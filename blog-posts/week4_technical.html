			<p class="paragraph">Arrays are data structures that are used to store multiple pieces of data. You can look at them as a variable that has multiple pieces of data in it. They can hold numbers, strings, symbols, and even other arrays. They are typically used when the data they hold doesnt require a specific name, also known as a key. To access a specific piece of data from within an array, you could use something called an index. Arrays use a counting system that starts with 0, which means that the first item in an array is called upon by 0, not 1. Arrays are created in a similar method as varibles. The only difference being that you would use square brackets ( [ ] ) after the = assignment operator.</p>

			<h2 id="website_name">Hashes</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Hashes are also data structures that are commonly used in programming. They too have the ability to store multiple pieces of data, and are capable of storing the same data types as an array. The key difference (pun intended) between the two would be the method of calling upon the hashes data. Each piece of data has a "key" associated with it. These keys serve as a name for the individual pieces of data, allowing you to referene a piece of data by its key. This makes hashes very useful for holding data which represents details about something. For example, you can have a class called "bank_account" and have it store data like "balance" => 1000, written exactly that way. Hashes are also very useful when instantiating objects, which we wont get into right now.</p>
