			<h2 id="website_name">Apple, Inc.</h2>
			<p id="paragraph">All things considered, I would have to say that Apple's website is probably my all time favorite. Although I dont think its the best looking site that I've ever seen, I really appreciate their attention to detail. They exercise such taste with their designs, which applies to both hardware and software. Every time I look at their website, I can see the refinement at play. I also like how Apple is very comfortable using white space. This has a huge effect on how allowing the user to focus and not become distracted by other things. They also take the time to do world class photography and only include vivid, lifelike photos on their pages. You almost feel like you can reach in and grab the devices. The result is a pixel perfect fit and finish that makes the website feel very trustworthy.</p>

		<div id="page_body">
			<h2 id="website_name">YouTube</h2>
			<p id="paragraph">I chose YouTube as my second favorite design. My reason for doing this was because YouTube has created a very trustworthy platform for video streaming. Due to their domanance, the layout has become somewhat of a comfort zone for me. When I use other video streaming sevices, it just doesnt feel the same. I think YouTube did many things right with their design, particularly the screen sizes. The viewing area is just the right size for me. Finally, the controls are well thought out, and they are second nature for most users. I think despite YouTube's overall bland look, it deserves some credit for making an interface that has become the benchmark for what users expect.</p>

		<div id="page_body">
			<h2 id="website_name">Google, Inc.</h2>
			<p id="paragraph">My third choice is Google. I think there is a lot to be said about Google's approach to simplifying the user interface. Some may argue that they have taken it to the extreme, but I personally think that their approach is very good. For example, many browsers have search windows that allow the user to do a shortcut directly to Google just by typing their search term in the browser search box. Despite this shortcut, many users still prefer to visit Googles homepage and do the search from there. I think that speaks volumes about how effective their strategy is. Although Google offers many other services and interfaces, their homepage keeps the signature look.</p>
