			<h2 id="website_name">Blocks</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Blocks are special pieces of code that are usually passed into a method. They are one of the only things in Ruby that aren't considered to be an object. Blocks typically consist of a few lines of code that tell a method what to do. They can be created by passing them in between curly braces or do...end statements. The main drawback of using a block as opposed to a proc or lambda is the fact that they have to be rewritten everytime you want to use them.</p>

			<h2 id="website_name">Procs</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Procs are reusable blocks. They store blocks of code into a variable and can be called on multiple occasions. Procs are considered to be objects by Ruby, which is useful because methods can be called upon them. In general, procs help improve code by reducing the redundancy in any given program. They can be created in a number of ways, one of which is illustrated above. Procs are very similar to Lambdas.</p>

			<h2 id="website_name">Lambdas</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Lambdas are very similar to procs. The main difference is that lambdas will execute their code and return back to the method, pretty much as though the lambda was executed in line. A proc would exit the method after it executed its code. Another key difference between a proc and lambd is that lambdas require a specific amount of arguments, while procs do not. Procs ignore all following arguments after the required argument has been satisfied.</p>
