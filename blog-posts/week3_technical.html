			<p class="paragraph">Javascript is an object oriented programming language. It is most commonly associated with client side web browsers, where it has nearly 100% browser penetration. Javascript can also be used on the server side via platforms like Node.js. Javascript was created by Brendan Eich, and first appeared in 1995.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Javascript is very popular within the web development community due to its dominance as a client side scripting language for web browsers. Its not common to see one programming language be the only option for a particular application. Due to this fact, almost all developers who are doing any front end work will have to interact with javascript to some degree.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Besides the more obvious front end use cases for Javascript, there are many other things that can be done with this versatile language. Many games are developed in Javascript, or variants of the langauge that comply with the ecmascript standard. As mentioned earlier, Javascript has also been used for back end work, particularly through the use of platforms like Node.js. Javascript is also very useful for creating powerful desktop applications such as graphics editors.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Some of the main advantages of Javascript are that it can run on the client side, thus relieving some of the workload from the server and allowing in decreased bandwidth. The language is also relatively easy to learn, which makes it a great language for beginners. There is also a ton of support online for developers. Javascript is also in high demand right not, and like for the forseeable future. This means that a Javascript developer will likely find work more easily than a developer of a less popular language such as Python.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Just like any language, there are disadvantages to Javascript as well. Perhaps the best documented issue would be the cross browser inconsistency. Since browsers are all different, they dont always comply with the exact same standards. This is a problem for a programming language because it follows its own set of standards. This results in certain effects and events performing differently between major browsers. Javascript also has security issues. These issues result from the fact that Javascript runs in the browser on the client side, and can load malicious scripts when a page is downloaded.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">All in all, Javascript is a fantastic programming language that has enabled many ground breaking advancements in the world of web development. I absolutely plan on expanding my knowledge in Javascript in the coming years.</p>
