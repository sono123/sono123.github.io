				<h2 id="header">Pairing and Feedback</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Generally speaking, I really enjoy pair programming. I find that my productivity levels are not impeded, while my accuracy increases. I think the most notable benefit for me is having another perspective. There have been multiple instances where my partner came up with a totally different solution than I did, which gives me more tools to use in my own arsenal. I also find it easier to tackle a problem with a partner. Sometimes, you dont know where to start when you are programming by yourself. Having a partner to talk to definitely helps because you can think out loud.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">I think the most challenging aspects of pair programming would be my ability to communicate. I never realized that the vocabulary and terminology would make such a difference, but it does. I have had a few instances where it was difficult to get my point across without writing the code. This is something that I need to work on. I also found that pair programming requires a certain level of chemestry between the participants. Not much, but at least a little. I've had one pairing session that I didnt really feel comfortable in. I had no chemestry with the person, so it wasnt very enjoyable. But at least we still got the job done.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Following the pairing sessions, we normally give feedback. This is something that was somewhat interestsing to me. I never thought we would be doing something like this, but I can certainly see its merits. When I read my first piece of feedback I remember feeling complimented. It was nice hearing positive feedback from someone you've worked with. When I read my first piece of non-complimentary feedback, I was a little defensive at first, but then I realized that this is purely communication. I was surprised by what I heard, and it definitely made me more conscious about how I come across. This is probably a good ting.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">I found writing feedback to be somewhat tricky. The reason is because you want your feedback to be useful, so you have to be careful about how you write it. For example, if I wanted to point out an area where my pair could improve, you can't just say "you arent good at that". You have to figure out a way to word it such that the recipient will not take offense to it. That is probably the biggest challenge.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Overall, I really like pairing and wish to continue doing it. My only preference would be to pick my partners. As discussed, I didnt have chemestry with one of the people, and I would rather not force myself to do that again if I work better with someone else. Also, I've paired with someone much more advance than myself. Although this was super insightful and the person was amazingly helpful and mindful, I felt that I didnt really contribute in a meaningful way. I think that person may be better off pairing with someone closer to his/her level. Maybe after I've paired with everyone once, we can then pick who to pair with.</p>
